# Effect-size
Employ effect size as a feature selection method to diagnose breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The main idea of this work is to give a new alternative to making a feature selection. 


The work is organized as follows:
Diagnose breast cancer_github.R presents the feature selection task with RFE, LVQ and Cohen's d, and the evaluation of the SVM model.
Cohen's d.R gives the Cohen's d values of each feature and an exploratory analysis.
Model validation.R computes a cross-validation in several Machine Learning models to know which performs best. 
Finally, Graphs.R contains any graph of the features
