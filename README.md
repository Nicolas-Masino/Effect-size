# Effect-size
Employing effect size as a feature selection method to diagnose breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The main idea of this work is to propose a new alternative for feature selection.

The work is organized as follows: 
'Diagnose breast cancer_github.R' presents the feature selection tasks with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), and Cohen's d, along with the evaluation of the SVM model. 
'Cohen's d.R' provides the Cohen's d values for each feature and includes exploratory analysis. 
'Model validation.R' performs cross-validation across several machine learning models to determine the best performer. 
Finally, 'Graphs.R' includes various charts illustrating the features.
